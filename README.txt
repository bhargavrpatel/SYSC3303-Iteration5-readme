The entire README has been converted into a series of HTML documents for your convenience. 
There, we were able to embed images and paste Console output fragments without making it harder for you to read.

We have done this with permission from Mr. Vilas (The other TA).

To start reading, simply run the README.html file. The documentations look MUCH better on Firefox or Chrome. 
I am using some javascript methods that maybe deprecated in Internet Explorer (if the school has older versions)
All the other html files are located in README-FILES folder but you do not need to access them yourself.

Just open the README.html it serves as a table of contents.

Regards,
Group 3.
